*moby.txt*

moby.vim is a Vim file that lets you use the Moby thesaurus from
Project Gutenberg as Vim's 'thesaurus'.

*moby-installation*

Put the file moby.vim in one of your Vim plugin directories,
e.g., ~/.vim/plugin.

In your vimrc or via a file in a plugin directory, set the option
'thesaurus' (aka 'tsr') to the pathname that you want to contain
the Moby thesaurus.

When you call Vim next, it will automatically take care to get
the Moby thesaurus from the Gutenberg site, name it to what the
'tsr' option says, and make minor modifications to it so that
Vim's thesaurus commands can deal with it.

(Notably, Vim considers each line in the thesaurus file as a list
of synonyms separated by spaces or commas or apostrophes. Our
function call keeps the commas as-is, but converts the spaces and
apostrophes into non-separating characters. This allows synonyms
to be phrases with spaces in them, or words or phrases with
apostrophes in them.)

The thesaurus gets downloaded and installed only once.  moby.vim
can be discarded after that.
